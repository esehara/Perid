Programmig Language "Perid"
=============================

What is "Perid"?
------------------
"Perid" is "Lightware Language" made Go lang.

"Perid" named from "Peridot" jewel.

### feature against Other Progamming Language.

* Dyanmic typing base
* Functional-like Programming Language

Why?
----

I like Haskell, OCaml, Scala. but It is "Heavy" because of "Static type-checking". I know "type inference", but not can not use "light-heartedly".

Simply. "Static Type" annoy many people. Then, I decide to make "Dyanamic typing Fucntional Programming Language", and leaning "Funcational Thinking" :D !!
